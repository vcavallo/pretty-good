# Pretty Good

A nostr desktop client for linux, mac, and windows.

The goal of this project is to build a functional and genuinely useful decentralized web of trust using a new model for decentralized knowledge representation and curation that I call the <i>threaded tapestry</i>.

This is a fork of [electron-nostr](https://github.com/wds4/electron-react-boilerplate-nostr) and is based on [electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate). 

As of April 2023: *** still in alpha ***

## Curated Lists: decentralized web of trust

Curation of items on a list by a decentralized web of trust. This is the simplest demonstration of the threaded tapestry model I have been able to devise so far that demonstrates knowledge representation as well as knowledge curation.
