# Overview of the list of Nostr Clients

When a new list is created, it is stored in nostr as a kind 9901 event. Information about the list is provided by the list overview page.

### General info about the list of Nostr Clients

  />
</span>

The smiley faces can be expanded to reveal techincal info about how the list is encoded and stored on nostr, as per the DCoSL [Concept Graph protocol](https://github.com/wds4/DCoSL/tree/main/dips/conceptGraph).

(Smiley faces with tech info are invisible unless the "show developer details for nostr nerds" option is checked under the settings for Pretty Good.)
