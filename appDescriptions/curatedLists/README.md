Curated Lists
=====

Curated Lists is built as a proof of concept for all of the [core principles and goals](https://github.com/wds4/DCoSL/tree/main/dips/coreProtocol) of DCOSL (with the exception of DIP-infiity), most notably DIPs 01 and 02.

Curated Lists allows any user to create a new list, add an item to any list, endorse or reject any user as a curator of any given list, and accept or reject any submitted item as belonging to the list in question.
