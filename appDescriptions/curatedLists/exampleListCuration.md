## Curated Lists Example: Curation of a list of nostr clients

In this example, a list of nostr clients has been created and curated. The "seed user" selector determines whose perspective is being depicted (whose grapevine is being used for the curation). Results are shown below from the perspectives of two different users: 
- wds4, a regular user
- joker4, a putative bad actor promoting a scam client created with nefarious intent

Note that, in accordance with [DIP-01](https://github.com/wds4/DCoSL/blob/main/dips/coreProtocol/01.md), the results of curation depend upon the choice of seed user.

LEFT PANEL: From the perspective of wds4, "scammy fake client" is rejected from the list, with several legit clients accepted onto the list and several others awaiting curation by the grapevine. RIGHT PANEL: From the perspective of the joker, "scammy fake client" is the only one accepted onto the list, with one legit client having been rejected. 

Why do they see different results? How does wds4 know that joker is a bad actor? How are the lists sorted? Users do not have to dig into the details if they don't want to. Like an automobile, you don't have to know how it works to use it. But for users who are even a little bit curious, they will be able to dig in all they want. See [this page](exampleListCurationGrapevine.md) for an overview of how list items are accepted and rejected.
