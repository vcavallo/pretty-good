        The grapevine is currently in the inactive state. Maybe you should turn
        it on! This will allow you to:
        <br />
        <br />
        <li>rate users along multiple dimensions</li>
        <li>curate message streams in a variety of ways</li>
        <br />
        For starters, you may want to allow your Grapevine to manage your list
        of trusted nostr relays dynamically so you don't have to!
      </div>
    </>

export default InactiveGrapevine;
